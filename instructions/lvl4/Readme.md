### Level 4

We now have some reporting and we are ready to start the next feature. 
The final goal is to "watch" a directory and upload every file in this directory.
Normal webpages are not allowed to "watch" directory, so we have to build a desktop app to access the system, with Electron (https://electronjs.org/) or node-webkit (https://nwjs.io/) or ...?

* Setup the framework
* Integrate your app with this framework
* Do not make the `watch` function yet, this is the next level

When you are done -> [Next Level](https://github.com/honestica/frontend-jobs/tree/master/lvl5)
